# LEO Satellite Communication Simulation Framework for Connected Vehicles

This repository maintains a submodule for SimuSCS (https://github.com/ToyotaInfoTech/simu-scs.git). 
The programs are developed based on Veins-5.2 (https://github.com/sommer/veins). We slightly modified the original modules to run them with other components in SimuSCS.
